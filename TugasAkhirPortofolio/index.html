              <p>
                I am a third-year student in Mechatronics Engineering Education
                with a strong passion for programming. Since my first year, I
                have been actively involved in the Robotics Student Activity
                Unit (UKM Robotika) at Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta. I have
                proficiency in programming languages such as Arduino, STM32,
                C/C++, and Python. My dedication lies in continuously expanding
                my skills and knowledge, particularly in robotics and
                automation.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, I am now also exploring the world of web
                programming with HTML and CSS, allowing me to expand my
                creativity in software development. I am eager to grow,
                innovate, and contribute to technological advancements in this
                field.

          <h3>Programmer Division - UNY Robotics Team</h3>
          <h4>October 2022 - Present</h4>
          <p>
            I joined the UNY Robotics Team as a member of the programming
            division. Here, I have honed my skills in various programming
            languages such as C++, Python, and C. Additionally, I have gained
            hands-on experience with microcontrollers like STM32, Arduino, and
            ESP32. I am also actively involved in the field of computer vision,
            particularly in implementing object detection using platforms like
            Roboflow and Ultralytics. This experience has deepened my
            understanding of system integration and software development, which
            serves as a strong foundation for creating efficient and functional
            websites.

          <h3>BAZNAS Scholarship Recipient</h3>
          <h4>September 2024 - Present</h4>
          <p>
            I was selected as a recipient of the BAZNAS Scholarship Batch 6,
            which provides financial support for my education in programming.
            This scholarship has allowed me to focus on developing skills,
            including microcontroller programming and system integration, which
            are highly valuable in complex website development.

          <h3>PKKMB Guide at UNY 2023</h3>
          <h4>August 2023</h4>
          <p>
            I had the opportunity to serve as a guide during the Introduction to
            Campus Life for New Students (PKKMB) at Yogyakarta State University.
            My responsibilities included introducing campus facilities, academic
            systems, and student organizations to new students. This experience
            honed my communication and presentation skills, which are essential
            for team collaboration in website development.

          <h3>Shutterstock Contributor</h3>
          <h4>September 2021 - Present</h4>
          <p>
            As a Shutterstock contributor, I upload high-quality photographs to
            the platform, providing a diverse range of visual content, including
            landscapes, portraits, and creative compositions. This experience
            allows me to contribute to a global library of images, which can be
            utilized for various purposes, including website design and digital
            media.
